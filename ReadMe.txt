In this folder, there are a total of 5 files and 1 folder

matrix.txt - the matrix we need to optimize.
Algorithm.py - the algorithm for the backward framework.
main.py - the process for deal with the output.
run.py - the main process to run our algorithm for multiprocessing in python.

This program requires Python3.
There are also 2 arguments that one has to set during compile time: 

An example is shown as follows.
	matrix.txt - a given matrix

	We create a folder 'result'.
	Then, we run 'run.py' to optimize the matrix.
	All the results can be seen in the folder 'result'.
